## Local Testing

To test locally, you need a local web server due to CORS restrictions:

```bash
# Using Python 3
cd docs
python -m http.server 8000

# Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

## Files

- `index.html` - Main viewer page
- `styles.css` - Dark theme styling
- `viewer.js` - Interactive functionality
- `library.json` - Your song library data (generated by scanner.py)

## Updating Your Library

When you add new songs:

1. Run the scanner again to regenerate library.json
2. Copy the new library.json to docs/
3. Commit and push to GitHub
4. GitHub Pages will automatically update

## Dropbox Integration

The viewer can display download links to files stored in Dropbox.

### Setup

1. Copy the example config file:
   ```bash
   cp config.example.js config.js
   ```

2. Edit `config.js` and set your Dropbox base URL:

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
    // Your Dropbox folder URL
    dropboxBaseUrl: "https://www.dropbox.com/home/RockSmithDLC",

    // Set to true if files are organized in artist subdirectories
    dropboxOrganizedByArtist: true,
};
```

3. When configured, platform badges (PC/Mac) become clickable download links with a ⬇ icon

**Note:** `config.js` is gitignored to keep your personal Dropbox URLs private. Use `config.example.js` as a template.

### Finding Your Dropbox URL

1. Go to dropbox.com and navigate to your Rocksmith DLC folder
2. Copy the URL from the browser address bar
3. The URL should look like: `https://www.dropbox.com/home/YourFolder`
4. Paste this into `config.js`

### Organization Options

- **Organized by Artist** (`dropboxOrganizedByArtist: true`):
  - Use if your files are in subdirectories like `RockSmithDLC/Artist Name/song.psarc`
  - The viewer will construct URLs with the artist folder path

- **Flat Structure** (`dropboxOrganizedByArtist: false`):
  - Use if all files are in one folder like `RockSmithDLC/song.psarc`
  - The viewer will link directly to files in the base folder

## Customization

You can customize the appearance by editing `styles.css`. The color scheme is defined in CSS variables at the top of the file.
